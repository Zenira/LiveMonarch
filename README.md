# Redesign for livemonarch.com

My goal with this project is to redesign the livemonarch.com website and add modern functionality.
How to run:

1. To run the website, run the command "npm install".
2. Run the command "npm run build".
3. The website will run on port 3000. When the server output says "listening on port 3000", go to http://localhost:3000/ to view the website.
