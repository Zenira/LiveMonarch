# Redesign for livemonarch.com
#
# My goal with this project is to redesign the livemonarch.com website and add modern functionality.
#
# How to run:
#
# 1. Make sure you have node, nodemon, express, and mongodb installed
# 2. Run mongod
# 3. In another command window, navigate to the folder and run "nodemon app.js"
# 4. The website will run on port 3000. When the server output says "listening on port 3000", go to http://localhost:3000/ to view the website.
